	abstract = {To optimize the site selection of wind turbines, it is essential to understand the variability of wind speeds at different elevations on mountains and their wind characteristics. The erection of anemometer at a large altitude in mountainous regions poses significant financial and safety challenges. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to design a method that facilitates the estimation of multiple high-elevation wind speeds utilizing low-elevation measurements. This study built a graph data structure by assimilating prior knowledge, including the mountain topography and relative position of the anemometer. A custom-designed graph neural network model was designed to predict wind speed data at high-elevation regions based on wind speed data at a low-elevation region. Moreover, an enhanced {UNet} model was employed to predict wind field data at higher elevations utilizing predicted wind speed data. To improve the stability and performance of the model, the flux conservation equation was integrated into the loss function of the graph neural network. The results suggest that integrating mountain information and physical loss in the model can significantly improve the accuracy of wind speed data predictions. The graph neural network has remarkably enhanced the performance of the {UNet} model.},

	abstract = {The goal of sustainable development can be attained by the efficient management of renewable energy resources. Wind energy is attracting attention worldwide due to its renewable and sustainable nature. Accurate wind speed prediction is essential for the stable functioning of wind turbines to generate wind power. However, the flexible and intermittent nature of wind speed makes accurate wind speed forecasting a challenging task. The proposed wind speed forecasting framework combines the features of various data decomposition techniques and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory ({BiDLSTM}) networks. Presently, Data Decomposition models such as the Wavelet Transform are extensively employed for wind speed forecasting to improve the accuracy of the forecasting models. Hence, in this paper, various data decomposition techniques that can denoise the signal are investigated and applied to partition the input time series into several high and low-frequency signals. The data decomposition methods, namely, Wavelet Transform, Empirical Model Decomposition, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition, and Empirical Wavelet Transform, have been applied to denoise the dataset. The low and high-frequency sub-series are forecasted separately using Bidirectional {LSTM} networks, and the forecasting outcomes of low and high-frequency signals are aggregated to get the final forecasting results. The empirical results establish that the proposed {EWT}- based hybrid model outperforms other decomposition-based models in accuracy and stability. The performance of the {EWT}-{BiDLSTM} model is further compared with Bidirectional {LSTM} networks with skip connections. The experimental results substantiate that the proposed decompositionbased hybrid deep {BiDLSTM} models with skip connections exhibit better prediction accuracy than other models.},

	abstract = {In recent years, wind power has emerged as an important source of renewable energy. When onshore and offshore wind farm regions are connected to the grid for power generation, consistent multi-location short-term wind power predictions are extremely valuable in terms of assuring the power system’s safety, sustainability, and economic operation. An abrupt variation in wind power generation influences the efficiency of the regional power grid. This makes accurate short-term forecasting essential for high-level planning and scheduling of power grids. To address the issue, this paper presents two variants of recurrent neural networks ({RNN}): gated recurrent unit ({GRU}) and long short-term memory ({LSTM}) models considering substantially better prediction accuracy to forecast a country-wide (Germany) wind power data for daily (t + 1), and multi-step (t + 3, t + 5, and t + 12) hours ahead. In addition, wind velocities [m/s] measured at heights of 2, 10, and 50-m (above ground level) are exploited as an essential characteristic among the available input variables and evaluated each feature subset based on four training divisions (80-20\%, 70-30\%, 60-40\%, and 50-50\%) and compared the results with {ARIMA} and {SVR} approaches in the literature. The findings reveal that the {RNN}-{GRU} model not only can achieve higher predicting accuracy but also has a faster learning speed over long sequences.},

Initially, variational mode decomposition is employed to decompose the complex wind speed time series into simpliﬁed modes. Interval prediction model and a point prediction model based on a gated recurrent unit neural network are designed to conduct interval prediction in primary mode and point prediction in rest modes, respectively, before the composition and construction of the prediction interval.

Currently, multiscale numerical simulation combining Weather Research and Forecasting ({WRF}) with Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) can achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy, but high computational costs and long processing times limit its real-time application. To address these challenges, this study presents an improved wind power prediction method that integrates multiscale numerical simulation coupled with deep learning to enhance both prediction accuracy and efficiency. This approach employs {WRF} for meteorological prediction, followed by a deep learning-based error correction strategy to refine wind speed predictions. Subsequently, the corrected data is input in to a {CFD} power database which is constructed by simulating the full-direction wind field. The proposed deep learning strategy preprocesses the data using Random Forest, Variational Mode Decomposition, and Principal Component Analysis, and corrects the data by combining Temporal Convolutional Networks, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks, Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks and Global Attention Mechanisms. The proposed model demonstrates excellent performance in short-term wind power prediction for an actual wind farm located in complex terrain. Compared to the reference model with the lowest mean absolute percentage error, the wind speed prediction error is reduced by 2.28 \%, and the wind power prediction error is reduced by 2.62 \%.},

An innovative neural network technique is implemented by cascading parallel convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) with a long short-term memory ({LSTM}) and a quantum-inspired neural network ({QINN}). The proposed hybrid model is optimized using two iterative loops: the outer loop is implemented by using quantum particle swarm optimization ({QPSO}) to tune the structure of model and other hyperparameters/parameters. The inner loop uses an Adam optimizer to tune the weights and biases of the proposed model. Spatiotemporal wind speeds at various locations provide the 2D input data.

	abstract = {As the demand for renewable energy is increasing, wind speed forecasting ({WSF}) becomes increasingly popular and essential for wind power generation. Several methods have been developed in the literature for {WSF}. However, {WSF} accuracy is challenging to obtain due to its non-stationary and non-linear character. To overcome this issue, this study suggests a novel integrated forecasting model for {WSF}. In the majority of cases, decomposition techniques are essential for removing noise and extracting patterns from non-stationary and nonlinear wind speed time series. Among these decomposition techniques, the most widely used decomposition methods based on frequency domain theory are the Fourier decomposition method ({FDM}), the empirical wavelet transform ({EWT}), and the variational mode decomposition ({VMD}). However, {FDM} decomposition gives inconsistent results, {EWT} has mixed problems, and {VMD} is unsuitable for non-stationary time series. Thus, a novel combined model based on empirical Fourier decomposition ({EFD}) techniques, long short-term memory ({LSTM}) neural networks, and the Grey Wolf optimizer ({GWO}) is proposed in this paper. Initially, the wind speed time series is decomposed using {EFD} into a set of sub-series and a residual, which is a stationary sub-series that can be easily modelled by a recurrent neural network ({RNN}). Further, the matching {LSTM} is used to forecast each sub-series and residual, while the {GWO} optimizes the sub-series estimated output, resulting in improved prediction precision and stability. In order to assess the model performance, five wind speed datasets from various places in India are employed. The findings show that the proposed model is the top performing model among the other ten models; The average statistical score obtained from all datasets reduces 11.01\% in the mean absolute error ({MAE}), 10.68\% in the root mean square error ({RMSE}) and 10.73\% in the mean absolute percentage error ({MAPE}). Further, regularity conditions for universal consistency of proposed model is also proved mathematically.},

              , and predict one value per gridbox. If weather varies markedly within a gridbox, forecasts for specific sites inevitably fail. Here we present a statistical post-processing method for ensemble forecasts that accounts for the degree of variation within each gridbox, bias on the gridbox scale, and the weather dependence of each. When applying this post-processing, skill improves substantially across the globe; for extreme rainfall, for example, useful forecasts extend 5 days ahead, compared to less than 1 day without post-processing. Skill improvements are attributed to creation of huge calibration datasets by aggregating, globally rather than locally, forecast-observation differences wherever and whenever the observed “weather type” was similar. A strong focus on meteorological understanding also contributes. We suggest that applications for our methodology include improved flash flood warnings, physics-related insights into model weaknesses and global pointwise re-analyses.},
